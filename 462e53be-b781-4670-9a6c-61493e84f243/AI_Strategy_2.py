        #    This step requires options data not shown in the provided examples.

        # 2. Determine if the option's strike price is within 5% of the true price of the underlying asset.
        #    Again, actual implementation would need detailed options data and market prices.

        allocation_dict = {ticker: 1/len(self.tickers) for ticker in self.tickers}

        # In reality, replace the above with logic to select options fitting the criteria
        # and allocate funds accordingly.
